      <p><strong>Version 1. Last updated: 2024-05-26.</strong></p>

      <p>These Terms and Conditions constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”) and the guestbook operators ("the operators", “we,” “us”, “our”, "me" or "I"), concerning your access to and use of the x-t.github.io (cmp.neocities.org) website (guestbook) as well as any other media form, media channel or mobile website related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, "the guestbook").</p>

      <p>You agree that by accessing (viewing or posting on (signing)) the guestbook, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all of these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with all of these Terms and Conditions, then you are expressly prohibited from using the guestbook and you must discontinue use immediately.</p>

      <p>The guestbook is intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the guestbook. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree to these Terms and Conditions prior to you using the guestbook.</p>

      <p>1. When making a post (signing), your IP address is logged for rate-limiting and cataloging purposes. Except when posting by e-mail (point 11).</p>

      <p>2. Your IP address can be stored outside the database in private logs and be used for geo-location analytical data. Except when posting by e-mail (point 11).</p>

      <p>3. You may only make one post (sign) every 30 minutes. Automated posting (signing) (such as with the aid of scripts or bots (i.e. external tools)) is strictly forbidden. You're only allowed to post (sign) from the official frontends (x-t.github.io and cmp.neocities.org) or e-mail (see point 11).</p>

      <p>4. Your signature name must be up to 32 characters in length and your signature comment must be up to 128 characters in length. If you won't provide a name, your post (signature) will be given the default name "Anonymous". Comments cannot be empty.</p>

      <p>4.1. Signatures are pseudo-anonymous. Providing a name is optional and using any identifiable information is discouraged. If you wish to identify in your signature, please make sure to understand the implications and liability of point 12. The guestbook does not verify the authenticity of any identification and signatures do not display any form of verification.</p>

      <p>5. Spam, fraud, phishing, impersonation (beyond the scope of point 4.1), copyrighted content, malicious code (such as computer viruses) and attempts to break the guestbook (via cross-site scripting (XSS) or any JavaScript (JS), HTML, SQL or CSS injection or similar efforts) are strictly forbidden.</p>

      <p>5.1. Repetitive or low-effort comments (content) (signatures) are loosely forbidden and may be removed.</p>

      <p>6. Inappropriate content (such as swearing (profanity), sexually adjacent or explicit content, harassment or otherwise) is strictly forbidden.</p>

      <p>7. Advertising (other websites, products, media, etc.) is strictly forbidden.</p>

      <p>8. Links may only be posted for personal websites and must follow points 5, 6 and 7. Links will be displayed, but won't be clickable.</p>

      <p>9. Your post(s) (signature(s)) may be edited or deleted for any purpose whatsoever by the operators without any notice.</p>

      <p>10. The backend guestbook software is hosted on Fly.io (as old-flower-8394.fly.dev), and the frontend software is hosted on GitHub (as x-t.github.io) and Neocities (as cmp.neocities.org). All of it is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA (proprietary, source-available) and the source code can be viewed on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/x-t/x-t.github.io">x-t/x-t.github.io</a>). We are not held responsible for Fly.io's usage with the data from the guestbook. Fly.io's terms of service can be found on <a href="https://fly.io/legal/terms-of-service/">https://fly.io/legal/terms-of-service/</a> and their privacy policy can be found on <a href="https://fly.io/legal/privacy-policy/">https://fly.io/legal/privacy-policy/</a></p>

      <p>11. You can make a post on (sign) the guestbook via e-mail by sending a request with intention to do so via my <a href="/email.html">e-mail address</a>. By choosing to do so, points 1 and 2 from these Terms of Service will not apply to you. If your request meets the requirements of these Terms of Service, your comment (signature) will be manually added by the operators for public view.</p>

      <p>12. You may not request to edit or delete guestbook post(s) (signature(s)), unless you find that a post (signature) (or several posts (signatures)) violate these Terms of Service or pose a threat for the stability of the guestbook or the safety of any person (or several people). Requests should be written via <a href="/email.html">e-mail</a>.</p>

# guestbook3

the fourth iteration of the forever-broken guestbook on x-t.github.io

it's not that special, it's fully api-compatible with the second iteration. that's mainly because the typescript one keeps breaking for no reason and i am fine with the api.

just this time it's written in go. i've tried a go guestbook before, this time i just know how to code. i guess.

works with [hypermedia](https://htmx.org/)

also is merged with mailguard, an api that just checks for a captcha response and if it's valid, will output html

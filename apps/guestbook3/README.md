# guestbook3

the fourth iteration of the forever-broken guestbook on x-t.github.io

it's not that special, it works.

this time it's written in go. i've tried a go guestbook before, this time i just know how to code. barely.

designed for [hypermedia](https://htmx.org/)

also is merged with mailguard, an api that just checks for a captcha response and if it's valid, will output html

now includes an admin interface on `/admin`! it's beautifully written (hacked together) using htmx and bootstrap 1.4.0. truly the work of an engineering genius.

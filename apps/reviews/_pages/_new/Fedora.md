# Fedora

Challenges:

- Run GTA San Andreas inside Wine

I have to say, I am sort of biased for Fedora. I love it. I used it on this Thinkpad for quite a bit after I decided to try it out again. I used Chromium OS, and then after starting to hate Chromium, I went off to Fedora. This got me into using RHEL & Rocky Linux on my servers, so yeah, I think Fedora made quite an influence on me for what a good distro should look like.

However, these reviews were always opinionated, so think that this fact only allows me to talk about one more subject on this distro.

## stability

Oh yeah, let’s get to that. We all know RHEL is stable, millions of machines run on it and depend on Red Hat’s ability to not screw something up. Debian is also stable, sometimes it still screws up, but I can attest by running a never-down 3+ year old install of Raspbian. I’ve also used things on the opposite scale, like Arch or Manjaro, something so unstable I had to keep reinstalling my OS every few months or weeks. So, is Fedora stable?

No. It is not. However, I like Fedora not because it’s stable, because it isn’t, but the amount of safeguards in place where it can break, but you’re not screwed. One of the most interesting things about Fedora is how fast the kernel moves on it. I’ve never seen a distro offer the option of the mainline kernel. Nightlies. That’s sort of never good, but if you run Rawhide, that’s what you get. But in regular releases, things move fast, things break, but rolling back is really easy.

I never had broken applications from updates, I only had broken kernel updates, which were as easy to roll back as hitting the down arrow once in the GRUB boot screen.

## technology

Another cool thing about Fedora is its fast adoption of technologies. Not even counting the fast that it gets nearly the newest packages, you also get to try out the “Linux of the future” or something. Btrfs and Wayland are some of the coolest things in Linux right now and Fedora gives you both for free, and have been giving them for a very long time now. All you have to do is run Anaconda.

## the challenge

I first tried PlayOnLinux. That failed quickly.
Then I tried to use wine by itself. That failed a bit later.

Afterwards I used Crossover and that handed it straight to me: the graphics card was too old to run anything. And it actually worked... well... up to this, anyway.

Once again, somehow proprietary software works the best. Weird how that works.

## conclusion

I don’t know what to write, really. It’s my distro of choice, that’s all.

If you want a good, up to date and safe desktop experience with Linux, I think Fedora is probably the best call. Built on good stuff by good people, giving a vanilla edition of your favorite DE to improve upon by yourself is something that I think a lot of intermediate/advanced/fed-up users of Linux will enjoy, I know I do.

If Linux had to be my main, I’d definitely choose Fedora now. But thankfully, it’s not.

Due to me being a very rampant distro hopper, I have amassed a lot of knowledge on operating systems. From 2017 to 2019 I have written reviews about some of them. However, Iâ€™ve been using macOS steadily since 2019, so whatever knowledge from back then, and even my mind, has changed. Thus, in 2021 I have decided to revisit these forgotten lands and write something... more insightful... letâ€™s say. Enjoy the incoherent mess.

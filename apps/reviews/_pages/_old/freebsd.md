# FreeBSD review

| Kernel |	FreeBSD |
| Init system | svchost.exe (actually it's rc) |
| Releases |	lol |
| Userland |	FreeBSD |
| Package management |	pkgng and ports |
| libc |	FreeBSD |

FreeBSD, IMO, is the second best OS that UNIX has to offer. It's the best BSD out of them all and it beats all Linux distros by a good margin. Although, being a pretty small operating system (community-wise), there are definitely support issues.

## Packages

Basically Linux ports. There's nothing special here, some packages are outdated, some don't work, some aren't ported. If you find a feature that doesn't work due to the developer base being 16 people, they'll basically tell you to fix it yourself.

pkgng is my favorite package manager by far, it never broke, the commands make sense, I had no complaints. This is a far shot from xbps or apt which made by butthole sore.

I guess you could make more stuff work on it via the Linux compatibility layer, but I never got it working.

## Installation

The installer is fine. The hardware support isn't.

Practically, if it doesn't work out of the box, there isn't much to do other than to write your own drivers.

## Usability

### Advanced use

Exactly as Linux. It comes completely minimal out of the box with you having to install a DE yourself.

Other than that, you'll need to learn a few things like /etc/rc.conf, but other than that, it's exactly the same.

### Simple use

No.

## Where is FreeBSD used?

Three people and two companies' servers. The entire point of FreeBSD is that they got stolen by Sony (PS3) and Apple (macOS).

## Conclusion

| | |
| - | - |
| Pro | Best software support out of BSDs
| Pro | Best hardware support out of BSDs
| Pro | Appeals to boomers because it's UNIX
| Mixed | Linux compatibility layer is cool, but I never got it to work.
| Con | Broken software
| Con | Small community (software fixes will never come)
| | |

All in all, I kinda like it, it's the cleanest cumrag of them all.

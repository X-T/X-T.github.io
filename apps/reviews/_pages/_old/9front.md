9front is probably the most niche operating system you can think of. There's a community on it called cat-v and the operating system itself is as terrible as the people.

## Packages

There are none.

## Installation

It does have an installer. It's only a script but at least it does have something.

Hardware support is... let's say if you have anything newer than a Core 2 Duo, it's not supported.

## Usability

### Advanced use

What are you gonna use it for? It has no software

### Simple use

Where is 9front used?

I think there's one server somewhere that uses it. 9front is really a research OS without any purpose other than reading it's horrid source code. Other than that, the developers use Windows or OpenBSD.

## Conclusion

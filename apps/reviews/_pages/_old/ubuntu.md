Ubuntu is probably the most easily-working distro there is, because it works. You pop it in and it works. It combines everything you need - drivers and software so you don't have to spend an hour installing software.

## Packages

Ubuntu is the most developed-for platform, because many cross-platform devs do not care about other distros, as Ubuntu is the most popular. This means that not only will you get all Linux's software, you'll also get packaged debs, this means all you'll have to do is double click and the software is installed.

apt, like in Debian, is still bad, although Ubuntu does look like they're putting in an effort to make it better. By making snappy. The amount of GUI updater/software management tools got annoying for me though.

## Installation

<description class="hidden" id="92a0881b-46e4-4a48-906b-1c15da6f03bd">Image split in two sides, left side: smug Pepe with Ubuntu logo in a pool/vila setting, text below reads: "I downloaded the ISO and it came with this pool and cabana thing all for free. Did I mention the pool dug itself and the house built itself on their own in 15 minutes? It's capable of doing 1000 things, I use it for a house, works perfectly. If it can do \***\* that I never need, I don't care, I never push those buttons. Now that I'm finished let me tell you about my comfy quilts I make as you can see". Right side: angry-crying wojak with Arch Linux logo shoveling dirt from back of pick-up truck, text below reads: "Digging the pool yourself means it will fill up 3% faster. Not even using a crane or any machine to move this dirt faster, I'll move it all manually by hand. Was having lots of fun using a spoon but that broke sadly. Honestly, thinking of only taking up half loads with this shovel so it takes longer. Steel houses are better, real hardcores can sleep on hard steel and be like `I don't even give a \*\***, yo`. It's actually finished. The fact that it's missing all the amenities is a GOOD thing. This pain I'm obviously in is a sign of strength because I can take it. THis will take a few weeks to do myself but once it's finished it will be better than ubuntu's house. Also I don't really plan to do anything with it once it's finished besides compare it to his and show him `I could do it too`"</description>

## Usability

### Advanced use

It's Linux, you can do whatever you want.

On my machine though it kept throttling my CPU to nothing, this wasn't a problem on any other distros. I also had to reboot my machine to get the speed back. Wtf?

### Simple use

This is one of those rare distros that your grandpa could maybe use. With enough training and annoying calls at 2AM on why his "photo collection" isn't working, it'll be fine.

## Where is Ubuntu used?

Desktops for minimalist people who want a working distro

Servers for sysadmins that cannot bother spending more of their useless time to set up a distro.

## Conclusion

|       |                                                 |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Pro   | Superb driver and software collection           |
| Pro   | Many debs and PPAs                              |
| Pro   | Your grandpa can use it                         |
| Pro   | Extremely easy to install                       |
| Mixed | Bloated. Personally it's not that bad           |
| Con   | Default comes with GNOME, ew                    |
| Con   | Suffers from everything that Linux suffers from |
| Con   | One of the first adopters of systemd.           |
|       |                                                 |

It's a pretty good OS, but it's not for me.

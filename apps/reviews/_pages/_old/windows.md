# Windows NT review

| | |
| - | - |
| Kernel |	A popular misconception is that it's NT. Well, the kernel is actually a subset of NT, and it's literally called "microkernel". [See here.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Windows_2000_architecture.svg) |
| Init system	| svchost.exe |
| Releases |	Whenever Microsoft was ready for a new version, from 10 they decided to make it rolling. |
| Userland |	Windows |
| Package management	| None, Chocolatey as substitute. |
| libc |	This.. uhh. Idk. A selection of DLLs, I guess. |
| | |

Windows - the gigantic behemoth in the desktop and server market, grabbing under half of the servers and a #1 majority on the desktops over 70%. Probably one of the most chad operating system designs out there, you can research NT a whole lot and really find out a different approach to an operating system, unlike all the UNIX cucks.

## Packages

If macOS has everything, Windows has everything everything. All software is on Windows, no exception, if it isn't, then no one uses that software, it's as simple as that.

As it lacks a package manager, every program updates by itself, I support this decision.

The biggest sector (and the one with the most attention) in Windows applications is gaymes.

## Installation

Next, next, next and you'll have a non-working system.

You will have to go through the internet hunting down drivers for about an hour and then you'll have a pretty OK system.

But if you're using Windows 10, enjoy spending another hour turning off all the ads and spyware.

## Usability

### Advanced use

No.

The most advanced thing you can do on Windows is probably research it. Which I did on Linux. It's pointless.

The "developers" of Windows are game developers, which use it for DirectX and the marketshare.

Other than that, the terminal is a mess and all the professional tools are boomer-tier, so...

On hardware issues, my fans kept spinning all the time way too much. My CPU temps were bad on all Windows versions.

### Simple use

Everybody uses/has used Windows. Everybody. There isn't really an issue with anyone.

## Where is Windows used?

Everywhere.

## Conclusion

| | |
| - | - |
| Pro | Spits in the face of UNIX
| Pro | Supports every application known to man
| Pro | Supports every piece of hardware known to man
| Pro | Your grandma doesn't need anything else
| Pro | DirectX performance/optimizations most of the time gives you better performance in gaymes
| Pro | Large community means there are people with the same hardware ready to help (not tech support)
| Con | Confirmed botnet. Even the calculator sends every keystroke to Microsoft.
| Con | Badly bloated. There isn't even an excuse like in macOS. Who needs a PIF editor in the 21st century?
| Con | Bogged down by a lot of legacyware. Windows 95 code is still in 10.

This is the best non-UNIX system there is, as probably literally the only one. I don't know why you would want it, but there it is. The only reason people use Windows is because they either play gaymes and contribute nothing to society or they're 50 and don't want to learn anything else. Windows has no fans, it only has paid shills. Fun story, as some were literally exposed by /g/ when they snapped and posted their Instagram.

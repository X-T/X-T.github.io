Elementary themselves say that the similarities are “unintentional” and I am betting money that’s total bull. But there are things that clone macOS, and there are things that imitate it. Pear OS, or your 2009 Windows XP Snow Leopard theme, that’s a clone. A really, really terrible one, and for good reason. You can’t just copy something huge like that.

And why not? Myself, I have been using this ecosystem for quite a while, and it’s super, super convenient. Airdrop, iMessage, Handoff, iCloud are just a few of the integration features between devices in a library of many others, too. It’s all smooth, like butter, but also, creates a walled garden, as the moment you switch off iPhone or Mac to Android or Linux, you immediately lose <em>all</em> functionality.</p> <p>Also, we don’t tend to replace everything at once, most of the time it’s just one thing - a laptop or a phone, not both. So, let’s take a seat in a consumer’s position who decided that after their Mac slowing down really bad (hypothetical btw), someone talked them into Linux, and to keep to the usual design they’re used to, they decided to install Pear OS. But, they still own an iPhone. Can you still pair them together to keep the bare minimum sync functionality?</p> <h2 id="catalina---installation">catalina - installation</h2> <p>The first thing I see after selecting to boot from USB is a KDE Neon logo.

Is it physically possible to write a theme for such a setup that would be a pixel-perfect recreation? How much work would that entail, even just the window borders, ignoring the fact that many utilities like Finder, Dock, Terminal, Calendar, Notes and all others would need to be totally rewritten from scratch as none look the same.</li> <li>This isn’t a project with a lot of manpower - it’s mainly lead by kids, and essentially installed by kids. As much as the website may suggest, it’s not a serious distro, you really shouldn’t be installing something this unstable on your main machine.</li> <li>The legality of the project is questionable at best - stolen wallpapers, stolen themes and designs are nothing short of just stealing. Yeah, Windows was a bit shameless in copying the designs, as well as GNOME, but they weren’t trying to remake pixel-perfect recreations. They were just trying to copy the best bits of the interface.</li> </ol> <p>So, yes. This is a bad distro.

Itâ€™s like 9front that got somewhere. Itâ€™s practically the only alternative operating system that has any hope, however tiny that is.</p> <h2 id="packages">Packages</h2> <p>No GTK port. Only a Qt one, even then, there is quite little you can do on it. Honestly, the amount of already existing software thatâ€™s ported to it is already astonishing for me, considering how small the operating system is. There are some games ported, like OpenTTD to give the OS a bit more meaning, but the fact is that itâ€™s nowhere near production.</p> <p>Haiku, like FreeBSD, splits itself into two parts - third party packages and the system. This means that you can have an older, more stable system (like r1beta1) without having packages lag behind, because theyâ€™re always rolling.</p> <p>I have no issues with Haiku Depot, itâ€™s probably my favorite software center, as every other one doesnâ€™t feel right.</p> <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2> <p>The r1beta1 image can install. On some hardware. Most drivers are pulled from FreeBSD, so the hardware support can be actually better than some other BSDs, like DragonFly or OpenBSD. However, the beta is outdated at this point, so itâ€™s always better to use a nightly image. Some boot, some donâ€™t, some have unknown issues after booting. Itâ€™s a mess really.</p> <h2 id="usability">Usability</h2> <h3 id="advanced-use">Advanced use</h3> <p>I wouldnâ€™t use this OS for regular day use, it doesnâ€™t have enough software to justify its usage.</p> <h3 id="simple-use">Simple use</h3> <p>This is an OS in constant development, no way.</p> <h2 id="where-is-haiku-used">Where is Haiku used?</h2> <p>Nowhere really. Itâ€™s a desktop OS and itâ€™s not ready for production. Linux isnâ€™t even close to overtaking anything after all these years. The desktop market is something else to handle, I donâ€™t feel like there is much hope for Haiku there.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Â </th> <th>Â </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Pro</td> <td>Interesting concept</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Pro</td> <td>Definitely one of the comfiest interfaces Iâ€™ve ever used</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Pro</td> <td>You can research it, there is definitely some non-POSIX elements there</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mixed</td> <td>Bloated.

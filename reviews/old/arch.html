The amount of crap in this one is an absolute behemoth. I cannot ever bother retesting this distro because this is crap.</p> <h2 id="packages">Packages</h2> <p>Packages in Arch aren’t split into anything, there are channels but nobody cares to use them. The real split is the main repository and the AUR. The main repository is sometimes more outdated than FreeBSD or Void, absolute meme. The AUR is also an absolute meme. The only purpose it serves is that Arch is too lazy to get actual package maintainers and maintain more packages than they do in the main repo.</p> <p>The AUR’s architecture is non-existant. The only thing standardized is “run this script”, and this is what AUR managers really do. These aren’t even packages most of the time. Sometimes these download a binary, sometimes they completely compile from source. Unlike in portage or apt, you don’t know what you’re going to get, it’s a mess. Honestly I ended up getting tarballs to avoid messing with it. I would rather use Slackware.</p> <p>Not to mention that pacman is also a pile of hunk, it’s so bad it’s an actual meme. Ever heard “Xorg breaking”? That’s because it’s true. pacman is so terrible it forgets that configs exist and you end up with a broken system. Some Xorg updates broke Xorg. Some Python updates deleted all Python configuration files. Other updates broke entire systems. Personally Arch screwed all my dynamic libraries, so no application worked at all. No way to get it back other than reinstalling. This is why I found out that Arch users keep the /home partition seperate from /, because they keep reinstalling their system so often.</p> <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2> <p>There’s no installer. You have to follow the instructions on the wiki, which doesn’t sound so bad until you remember “wait, wasn’t this longer?”. And yes, it was. Arch users hate newfriends so much they decided to shorten the install guide because why not? They removed some pretty useful information for no reason. I mean, yes, you’ll get an install working, but you won’t go as far.</p> <h2 id="usability">Usability</h2> <h3 id="advanced-use">Advanced use</h3> <p>Arch is haxxor loonix so you can do absolutely nothing other than post neofetches all day long because you have no life.</p> <h3 id="simple-use">Simple use</h3> <p>No newfriends are allowed into Arch, read the manual newfriend, you should go back to Noobuntu you fool!</p> <h2 id="where-is-arch-used">Where is Arch used?</h2> <p>r/unixporn and desktop threads. It’s not used anywhere else because it’s a trash distro.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <table> <thead> <tr> <th> </th> <th> </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Pro</td> <td>It has pretty up to date software</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Pro</td> <td>A pretty informative wiki, although IMO Gentoo’s is better</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Con</td> <td>pacman is trash</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Con</td> <td>The AUR is trash</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Con</td> <td>The community is toxic</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Con</td> <td>No installer</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Con</td> <td>No package splitting.

It’s a bad distro with a terrible community. It’s the only distro that I will never install in the entirety of my life. I hate it so much I want it to die. But I also don’t want it to die. It’s a “so bad it’s good” thing. It keeps all these elitist assholes in one place, so keep the distro up, I’ll talk bad about it, but thanks for existing.</p> <a href="/reviews/new/Arch_Linux.html" class="generic-button" style="text-decoration: none !important"> <span>📖 Go back to new review</span> </a> </article> </body> </html>

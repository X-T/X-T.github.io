You pop it in and it works. It combines everything you need - drivers and software so you don‚Äôt have to spend an hour installing software.</p> <h2 id="packages">Packages</h2> <p>Ubuntu is the most developed-for platform, because many cross-platform devs do not care about other distros, as Ubuntu is the most popular. This means that not only will you get all Linux‚Äôs software, you‚Äôll also get packaged debs, this means all you‚Äôll have to do is double click and the software is installed.</p> <p>apt, like in Debian, is still bad, although Ubuntu does look like they‚Äôre putting in an effort to make it better. By making snappy. The amount of GUI updater/software management tools got annoying for me though.</p> <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/old/pool_ubuntu.png"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/old/pool_ubuntu-400-58dedcce0.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/old/pool_ubuntu-600-58dedcce0.webp 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/old/pool_ubuntu-800-58dedcce0.webp 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/old/pool_ubuntu-1000-58dedcce0.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/old/pool_ubuntu-400-55baad4e8.png 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/old/pool_ubuntu-600-55baad4e8.png 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/old/pool_ubuntu-800-55baad4e8.png 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/old/pool_ubuntu-1000-55baad4e8.png 1000w" type="image/png"><img aria-describedby="92a0881b-46e4-4a48-906b-1c15da6f03bd" src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/old/pool_ubuntu-800-55baad4e8.png" alt="A meme that jokes about the Ubuntu installation process compared to Arch."></picture></a></p> <description class="hidden" id="92a0881b-46e4-4a48-906b-1c15da6f03bd">Image split in two sides, left side: smug Pepe with Ubuntu logo in a pool/vila setting, text below reads: "I downloaded the ISO and it came with this pool and cabana thing all for free. Did I mention the pool dug itself and the house built itself on their own in 15 minutes? It's capable of doing 1000 things, I use it for a house, works perfectly. If it can do **** that I never need, I don't care, I never push those buttons. Now that I'm finished let me tell you about my comfy quilts I make as you can see". Right side: angry-crying wojak with Arch Linux logo shoveling dirt from back of pick-up truck, text below reads: "Digging the pool yourself means it will fill up 3% faster. Not even using a crane or any machine to move this dirt faster, I'll move it all manually by hand. Was having lots of fun using a spoon but that broke sadly. Honestly, thinking of only taking up half loads with this shovel so it takes longer. Steel houses are better, real hardcores can sleep on hard steel and be like `I don't even give a ****, yo`. It's actually finished. The fact that it's missing all the amenities is a GOOD thing. This pain I'm obviously in is a sign of strength because I can take it. THis will take a few weeks to do myself but once it's finished it will be better than ubuntu's house. Also I don't really plan to do anything with it once it's finished besides compare it to his and show him `I could do it too`"</description> <h2 id="usability">Usability</h2> <h3 id="advanced-use">Advanced use</h3> <p>It‚Äôs Linux, you can do whatever you want.</p> <p>On my machine though it kept throttling my CPU to nothing, this wasn‚Äôt a problem on any other distros.

It‚Äôs not impossible, however, and some people (mainly Google) like the flexibility of Gentoo, with the ability to compile builds for yourself, with the features you want, but still reproducibly.</p> <p>Instead of saying ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôll install Gentoo today‚Äù, you have to start out with a plan. What you want. What you expect. How you‚Äôll do it. Here‚Äôs my idea.</p> <p><strong>The system</strong></p> <p>Here‚Äôs what I want to set up for this system. Mind you, I do not care for longevity here, I only want to install it. @world breakage is not in my mind.</p> <ul> <li>systemd</li> <li>gentooLTO</li> <li>X11</li> <li>Cinnamon</li> </ul> <p><strong>The build</strong></p> <p>Since this is a C2D, which is not known for its speed under load, I will take help from my Haswell MacBook, which will be running distcc inside a Docker container.</p> <p>With a rough plan. Let‚Äôs walk in. I have not done this in literal years.</p> <h2 id="installation">installation</h2> <h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3> <p>Started with the systemd stage 3. I got a chroot set up with distcc. I didn‚Äôt do a whole lot with it, as I was watching movies.</p> <h3 id="day-2">Day 2</h3> <p>I compiled the Linux kernel and rebuilt gcc with USE=graphite. Yeah, I used genkernel. I can‚Äôt be bothered with menuconfig mate, I spent hours trying to understand it back when I tried compiling OpenWRT.</p> <h3 id="day-3">Day 3</h3> <p>I started recompiling @world with ltoize, but after realising that it kept running in circles failing, I decided to drop this idea and start over.</p> <ul> <li><del>gentooLTO</del></li> </ul> <p>This time, I will drop LTO and install the base system normally, without distcc or dangerous optimisations.</p> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/new/Gentoo-1.jpeg"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-1-400-4e40747ed.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-1-540-4e40747ed.webp 540w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-1-400-f1b5b9b0a.jpeg 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-1-540-f1b5b9b0a.jpeg 540w" type="image/jpeg"><img src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-1-540-f1b5b9b0a.jpeg" alt="Pope holding up a fake Gentoo CD."></picture></a></p> <p><em>It‚Äôs great when it isn‚Äôt your main distro, as I no longer have to worry about taking 6 hours to compile LibreOffice to do an assignment that‚Äôs due in 20 minutes.</em></p> <h3 id="day-4">Day 4</h3> <p>Installed GRUB, finally booted from the hard drive.

I don‚Äôt know, but all I know is that I weirdly like it. Still though, this would be really, really annoying if this was my only machine. Which, back in the day, it was. It was sorta like speedrunning back then.</em></p> <p>Thus, I began the 395-long emerge of Cinnamon. Why Cinnamon exactly? It‚Äôs for nostalgia sake. The first time I installed Gentoo back in the day was with Cinnamon. I don‚Äôt like Cinnamon, I only want to remake the setup. Real Gentoo, real Cinnamon.</p> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/new/Gentoo-3.png"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-3-400-c096faea7.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-3-600-c096faea7.webp 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-3-800-c096faea7.webp 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-3-1000-c096faea7.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-3-400-3acc24181.png 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-3-600-3acc24181.png 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-3-800-3acc24181.png 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-3-1000-3acc24181.png 1000w" type="image/png"><img src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-3-800-3acc24181.png" alt="Screenshot of the Gentoo website saying 'Note: The compilation duration for net-libs/webkit-gtk can be very long, especially on older hardware.

I knew I would be going out for nearly all day, so all I did was set it to emerge Firefox, then left it there.</p> <p>Coming back home nearly midnight, Firefox had finished compiling, which was sort of surprising. No end in sight for the 200¬∞C Core 2, however, as it was immediately tasked with rebuilding @world with my new global USE flags. This included rebuilding gcc, so it‚Äôll go well into the night.</p> <h3 id="day-6">Day 6</h3> <p>Woke up to tmux having an ‚Äú[exited]‚Äù sign. That was probably my cat sabotaging me. However, it turns out that the tmux session was ended after @world was already rebuilt. I knew I‚Äôd be gone again, but that didn‚Äôt matter, as I set GDM and some QOL applications to emerge.</p> <p>About 3 hours later, I was ready to get the minimal (but possibly functional) system fixed up.</p> <p>Turns out I also somehow ended up with GNOME. No idea how that happened. All the fonts were missing and it had no terminal. So, more emerging was needed. Oh yeah, screen tearing too. God bless X11 üôè. In fact, it‚Äôs so good, that even after I set my X11 options to use sna/TearFree, I still had screen tearing. But truth be told I‚Äôm not going to be using this system, so I cannot be bothered to troubleshoot it.</p> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/new/Gentoo-4.png"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-4-400-a4612470b.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-4-600-a4612470b.webp 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-4-800-a4612470b.webp 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-4-1000-a4612470b.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-4-400-6e9307221.png 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-4-600-6e9307221.png 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-4-800-6e9307221.png 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-4-1000-6e9307221.png 1000w" type="image/png"><img src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-4-800-6e9307221.png" alt="Gentoo/Cinnamon desktop showing the output of neofetch."></picture></a></p> <p><em>A lot of things have changed since I was last here.</em></p> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/new/Gentoo-5.jpeg"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-5-400-c46e5adc6.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-5-600-c46e5adc6.webp 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-5-800-c46e5adc6.webp 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-5-1000-c46e5adc6.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-5-400-7e5c9c4e9.jpeg 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-5-600-7e5c9c4e9.jpeg 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-5-800-7e5c9c4e9.jpeg 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-5-1000-7e5c9c4e9.jpeg 1000w" type="image/jpeg"><img src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Gentoo-5-800-7e5c9c4e9.jpeg" alt="Gentoo/Cinnamon desktop showing the output of neofetch and Discord in the background"></picture></a></p> <p><em>In fact, here‚Äôs a photo from 2017 for reference.</em></p> <p>Now I was ready to go ahead and break the system.

I think I weirdly liked installing Gentoo. It does make me sad that I do have to say goodbye to this install, as it isn‚Äôt secure by my main standards and it‚Äôs still a C2D. Most of the time I will pull out a laptop like this if I need a tool right here, right now. Waiting 10 minutes to compile Brasero to burn a CD, while in the same time I could‚Äôve literally installed something like Fedora or Ubuntu and would‚Äôve burned it faster, Gentoo doesn‚Äôt make sense.</p> <p>It probably makes the most sense on newer and more powerful workstations. Something that can run Clear Linux and compile things quickly. At which point you will actually feel effects from -O3 -march=native optimisation, whereas on a C2D, it‚Äôs pathetically slow, and the speed improvements are essentially nil.</p> <p>Gentoo is also a stable distribution, well, as long as you do it right. It‚Äôs not supposed to be bleeding edge like Fedora or Arch, as source-based installations can be much more wonky than binary ones, thus to stabilise your system and save time rebuilding, packages are pretty much pinned with Debian-tier versions. To get newer unstable versions, you have to unmask packages, for example if you don‚Äôt want Firefox ESR (7x) you can unmask <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www-client/firefox</code> for your architecture (i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">package.accept_keywords -&gt; www-client/firefox ~amd64</code>) and this will give you the latest stable Firefox (93 as of writing). This means that even when it‚Äôs a rolling distro without versions, you‚Äôll still be using out-of-date software and/or experimental configurations. For example, PipeWire isn‚Äôt considered stable.</p> <p>It is sad to say goodbye to this beast, as it did take 8 days of effort afterall (a little over a third of the three weeks projected), but it is genuinely useless for me.</p> <p>Should you install Gentoo? Well, I don‚Äôt know. Gentoo is a so-called ‚Äúmeta-distribution‚Äù as the fact that you compile your own software allows for a very in-depth and integrated setup, as well as not having hard dependencies on the core components of the OS. You can pick and swap init systems, libc and even the kernel. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôd learn from it, considering nearly all of the work is done by Portage, and all you have to do is figure out how to use a compiler and bash. Other than that, I guess if you want to try it out, go ahead. It‚Äôs definitely fun.</p> <p>And as for the meme that even I believed in that ‚ÄúGentoo users are low-lifes with way too much free time‚Äù, I noticed that, well, that‚Äôs not particularly true. 98% of the time you do on Gentoo is wait and then, because it‚Äôs stable and doesn‚Äôt update too often, you use it as a normal Linux system. I think that if you use Gentoo, chances are you know perfectly well how to organise your time, you can put your time in several-hour windows to compile large applications, update your system, etc. and then use that time wisely for work, education, socialising or whatnot.</p> <p>In short, it got annoying how long it takes to compile everything, but it was genuinely a nice and pleasant distro to work with.</p> <div class="flex flex-row gap-x-3"> <a href="/reviews/new/Windows_11.html" class="generic-button" style="text-decoration: none !important" aria-label="Navigate to the previous review"> <div class="flex flex-column gap-x-3 items-center" aria-hidden="true"> <div> <svg class="w-6 h-6" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M12.707 5.293a1 1 0 010 1.414L9.414 10l3.293 3.293a1 1 0 01-1.414 1.414l-4-4a1 1 0 010-1.414l4-4a1 1 0 011.414 0z" clip-rule="evenodd"></path> </svg> </div> <div class="hidden md:inline">Previous</div> </div> </a> <a href="/reviews/new/OS_X.html" class="generic-button" style="text-decoration: none !important" aria-label="Navigate to the next review"> <div class="flex flex-column gap-x-3 items-center" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="hidden md:inline">Next</div> <div> <svg class="w-6 h-6" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="transform: scaleX(-1)"> <path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M12.707 5.293a1 1 0 010 1.414L9.414 10l3.293 3.293a1 1 0 01-1.414 1.414l-4-4a1 1 0 010-1.414l4-4a1 1 0 011.414 0z" clip-rule="evenodd"></path> </svg> </div> </div> </a> </div> </article> </body> </html>

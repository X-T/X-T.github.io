On a Thinkpad X200 (C2D, GMA).</li> <li>Is Snow Leopard still actually usable?</li> <li>Conclude this hell.</li> </ul> <p>I know this is my main OS I use for everything, so I will be somewhat biased. But to avoid that I wonâ€™t talk about the modern macOS, which is what I use. Instead, I will torture myself by Hackintoshing the X200, same C2D I used for all the reviews previously. I sort of tried this back in the day, but it failed miserably with no iGPU drivers, no mouse drivers, no keyboard drivers, actually, it had 0 drivers. So, yeah, maybe this time weâ€™ll do something better, eh?</p> <h2 id="opencore">opencore</h2> <p>Welcome to OpenCore! Itâ€™s the new way to hackintosh hardware, as Clover fell out of favor really quickly and Chameleon might as well be sent into the deepest pit in hell.</p> <p>Back when OpenCore started, I couldnâ€™t even install it on my X220, which had a Sandy Bridge CPU, and I continued to use macOS Mojave on it with Clover. If I were to redo the setup now, Iâ€™d use OpenCore, but I use a Mac now. â€¦which will be running <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/">OpenCore too</a>, soon enough.</p> <p>Anyway, letâ€™s take a look at the compatibility for our little X200, as knowing your hardware and your software is one of the steps for creating a Hackintosh.</p> <p><em>These charts do not take into account for old system patching. For example, OCLP linked above can install macOS 12.0 on a 2006 MacBook Pro with a Core 2 Duo, this will not touch us as youâ€™ll see shortly.</em></p> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/new/OS_X-1.png"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-1-400-0009a54d3.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-1-600-0009a54d3.webp 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-1-800-0009a54d3.webp 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-1-1000-0009a54d3.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-1-400-eb5ad99d1.png 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-1-600-eb5ad99d1.png 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-1-800-eb5ad99d1.png 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-1-1000-eb5ad99d1.png 1000w" type="image/png"><img src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-1-800-eb5ad99d1.png" alt="OpenCore compatibility chart showing Penryn to be initially supported since 10.4.10 and until 10.13.6"></picture></a></p> <p>The Core 2 Duo gives us a good vanilla window from Tiger to High Sierra, howeverâ€¦</p> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/new/OS_X-2.png"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-2-400-f3b0c8238.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-2-600-f3b0c8238.webp 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-2-800-f3b0c8238.webp 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-2-1000-f3b0c8238.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-2-400-ec3fb9347.png 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-2-600-ec3fb9347.png 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-2-800-ec3fb9347.png 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-2-1000-ec3fb9347.png 1000w" type="image/png"><img src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-2-800-ec3fb9347.png" alt="OpenCore compatibility chart showing 3rd Gen GMA graphics to be supported from 10.4.1 and 4th Gen from 10.5.0 until 10.7.5"></picture></a></p> <p>Our graphics do not. As all we have is Leopard to Lion support. As I already have done a <a href="https://github.com/x-t/x220-lion-efi">Lion Hackintosh on the X220</a>, I will try to use Snow Leopard (10.6) as a stand-in, as that was the version I wanted to put on the X200 in the first place, a few years back.</p> <p>So, Iâ€™ll have to make an OpenCore USB for a BIOS, Penryn, X3100 system. God help me.</p> <p>Why am I not using the old Hackintosh methods? Because they absolutely suck. Trust me, I remember all the iHack, Chameleon, Unibeast and the other crap that supposedly made it easier. It didnâ€™t. It sucked then and it sucks now, so if OpenCore canâ€™t do it, I wonâ€™t bother.</p> <h2 id="installation">installation</h2> <p>Step one was to replace my Wi-Fi card from the Intel one to a Broadcom one. I know it worked on Lion to Catalina on the X220, no idea how it works on the X200, but because Intel doesnâ€™t work at all on any machine, I have nothing to lose.</p> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-1.jpg"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-1-400-d2266486d.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-1-600-d2266486d.webp 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-1-800-d2266486d.webp 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-1-1000-d2266486d.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-1-400-3dfb56a9a.jpg 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-1-600-3dfb56a9a.jpg 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-1-800-3dfb56a9a.jpg 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-1-1000-3dfb56a9a.jpg 1000w" type="image/jpeg"><img src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-1-800-3dfb56a9a.jpg" alt="Laptop motherboard with an Intel Wi-Fi card in PCIe slot 1."></picture></a></p> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-2.jpg"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-2-400-c4d51e27c.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-2-600-c4d51e27c.webp 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-2-800-c4d51e27c.webp 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-2-1000-c4d51e27c.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-2-400-d117fa6fe.jpg 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-2-600-d117fa6fe.jpg 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-2-800-d117fa6fe.jpg 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-2-1000-d117fa6fe.jpg 1000w" type="image/jpeg"><img src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-HW-2-800-d117fa6fe.jpg" alt="Laptop motherboard with a Broadcom Wi-Fi card in PCIe slot 2."></picture></a></p> <p><em>I have to use it in the WWAN slot, otherwise the BIOS doesnâ€™t boot, because Lenovo and IBM historically implemented Wi-Fi allowlists, which suck beyond belief.</em></p> <p>With this, I got the BCM4322 in lspci, but for some reason Gentoo wouldnâ€™t allow me to use it, oh well, thatâ€™ll do well enough. Time to put the screws back in.</p> <p>Now I was in completely uncharted territory, I have hackintoshed before, even used it as my main computer, but I never tried OpenCore, Snow Leopard and definitely not on hardware this terrible.</p> <p>The guide was very straight-forward. Up until you actually have to set things up, at that point it becomes a spaghetti wrangle amount of paths. I also noticed that Penryn laptops arenâ€™t supported, only desktops. And since I know nothing about patching up my own, I went ahead with the desktop instructions. After spending a good hour in the config.plist not understanding anything, I was ready to send it off and boot. Fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž</p> <p>That did nothing as I was met with a very insightful error message</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OC: OcMiscEarlyInit...
OC: Failed to load configuration!
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Whatever that means. Turns out I misplaced the config.plist file. Okay then, moving on.</p> <p>This still didnâ€™t get me anywhere, as it was stuck while booting. One notice too, is that itâ€™s so slow. Like, genuinely slowest thing Iâ€™ve ever booted. Over a minute from a black screen to the picker menu level slow.</p> <p>I enabled fake NVRAM, but I still ended up being stuck at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">adding AppleEFINVRAM notification</code>. Willing to bet that Iâ€™m the first ever guy who came up with a configuration this ludicrous, so I started to remove kexts, to see if I would be able to boot in some sense.</p> <p>Left to the bare kexts, it was still stuck.</p> <p>Yeah, honestly, I donâ€™t even know where to go from here. Nothing here is documented, no one has ever thought to do this on an OS this old, hardware this old and a bootloader this new. Considering Iâ€™m totally new to this space, and this is absolutely advanced level trigonometry, I am literally giving up, this is not for me.</p> <p>Now, I do have an utility that could try and make the old-era Hackintosh solution howeverâ€¦</p> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/new/OS_X-3.png"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-3-400-3a19a6e8a.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-3-600-3a19a6e8a.webp 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-3-800-3a19a6e8a.webp 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-3-1000-3a19a6e8a.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-3-400-5ae6e999e.png 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-3-600-5ae6e999e.png 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-3-800-5ae6e999e.png 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-3-1000-5ae6e999e.png 1000w" type="image/png"><img src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-3-800-5ae6e999e.png" alt="Parallels Desktop error saying 'An invalid macOS version is installed.'"></picture></a></p> <p>It very much obviously doesnâ€™t work on Big Sur and I cannot get an old OS X on Parallels.</p> <p>Soâ€¦ what now?</p> <p>Well then, at this point, letâ€™s cross off the challenges</p> <ul> <li><del>Install it.

Letâ€™s try running Catalina inside a VM using macOS-Simple-KVM. I have done this before (with El Capitan) on the X200 and it ran like an absolute turd. I am expecting it to be even worse now, but I wasnâ€™t here for usability anyway.</p> <p><em>For OpenCore, though, see you soon. Hopefully installing it on a Mac wonâ€™t be a total hell like installing it on a PC.</em></p> <p>Iâ€™ll use elementaryOS, which is Ubuntu with a different UI as the KVM host. The SSD still has Gentoo, but you can gladly go choke on something if Iâ€™m waiting for QEMU to compile.</p> <h2 id="kvm">kvm</h2> <p>Yeah, a bit boring, and I honestly wouldâ€™ve preferred to do a Hyper-V setup, however the C2D is too old for Hyper-V.</p> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/new/OS_X-4.png"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-4-400-c3c41ba77.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-4-600-c3c41ba77.webp 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-4-800-c3c41ba77.webp 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-4-1000-c3c41ba77.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-4-400-b7282d524.png 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-4-600-b7282d524.png 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-4-800-b7282d524.png 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-4-1000-b7282d524.png 1000w" type="image/png"><img src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-4-800-b7282d524.png" alt="elementaryOS desktop showing output of neofetch."></picture></a></p> <p><em>Woah, weâ€™re back!</em></p> <p>However, as if it couldnâ€™t get any worse, Linux borderline refused to recognise VT-x. I accidentally disabled it in BIOS while installing, and after enabling, it doesnâ€™t bother. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vmx|svm</code> isnâ€™t listed in the CPU flags, and KVM doesnâ€™t start.</p> <p>I absolutely donâ€™t know how to even begin fixing this, itâ€™s borderline embarrassing for Ubuntu. I tried disabling VT-d and only leave VT-x, rebuilding initramfs and genuinely nothing got it to see a CPU flag thatâ€™s literally there.</p> <p>Either I performed the worst BIOS update of all time or Ubuntu is somehow the worst distro of all time. To find out, letâ€™s install Fedora instead. Iâ€™m genuinely getting sick of it all.</p> <p>On the Fedora Live CD, I looked at my /proc/cpuinfo and was met with the lack vmx, which made me believe that I totally ruined my board. However after installing it, KVM magically appeared out of nowhere.</p> <p>â€¦ what?</p> <p>Whatever, this means we can continue. After Iâ€™m finished I will try Ubuntu again to see if that will get back VT-x again, but for now, letâ€™s finish it off with Fedora.</p> <p>4 hours after starting the VM, it got beachballâ€™ed before even trying to launch the OOTBE. Oh well.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/new/OS_X-5.png"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-5-400-8b9151e6d.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-5-600-8b9151e6d.webp 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-5-800-8b9151e6d.webp 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-5-1000-8b9151e6d.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-5-400-b9a5d5f27.png 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-5-600-b9a5d5f27.png 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-5-800-b9a5d5f27.png 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-5-1000-b9a5d5f27.png 1000w" type="image/png"><img src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-5-800-b9a5d5f27.png" alt="Fedora/GNOME desktop with QEMU in the background having a beachball cursor icon and no windows, as well as a terminal on the right showing neofetch output."></picture></a></p> <p><em>Cool ball!</em></p> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/new/OS_X-6.jpg"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-6-400-321f77d2d.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-6-600-321f77d2d.webp 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-6-800-321f77d2d.webp 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-6-1000-321f77d2d.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-6-400-dc7665b5a.jpg 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-6-600-dc7665b5a.jpg 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-6-800-dc7665b5a.jpg 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-6-1000-dc7665b5a.jpg 1000w" type="image/jpeg"><img src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/OS_X-6-800-dc7665b5a.jpg" alt="macOS Big Sur desktop with an 'About My Mac' dialog."></picture></a></p> <p><em>This was a catastrophic failure.

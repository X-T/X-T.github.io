I love it. I used it on this Thinkpad for quite a bit after I decided to try it out again. I used Chromium OS, and then after starting to hate Chromium, I went off to Fedora. This got me into using RHEL &amp; Rocky Linux on my servers, so yeah, I think Fedora made quite an influence on me for what a good distro should look like.</p> <p>However, these reviews were always opinionated, so think that this fact only allows me to talk about one more subject on this distro.</p> <h2 id="stability">stability</h2> <p>Oh yeah, let‚Äôs get to that. We all know RHEL is stable, millions of machines run on it and depend on Red Hat‚Äôs ability to not screw something up. Debian is also stable, sometimes it still screws up, but I can attest by running a never-down 3+ year old install of Raspbian. I‚Äôve also used things on the opposite scale, like Arch or Manjaro, something so unstable I had to keep reinstalling my OS every few months or weeks. So, is Fedora stable?</p> <p>No. It is not. However, I like Fedora not because it‚Äôs stable, because it isn‚Äôt, but the amount of safeguards in place where it can break, but you‚Äôre not screwed. One of the most interesting things about Fedora is how fast the kernel moves on it. I‚Äôve never seen a distro offer the option of the mainline kernel. Nightlies. That‚Äôs sort of never good, but if you run Rawhide, that‚Äôs what you get. But in regular releases, things move fast, things break, but rolling back is really easy.</p> <p>I never had broken applications from updates, I only had broken kernel updates, which were as easy to roll back as hitting the down arrow once in the GRUB boot screen.</p> <h2 id="technology">technology</h2> <p>Another cool thing about Fedora is its fast adoption of technologies. Not even counting the fast that it gets nearly the newest packages, you also get to try out the ‚ÄúLinux of the future‚Äù or something. Btrfs and Wayland are some of the coolest things in Linux right now and Fedora gives you both for free, and have been giving them for a very long time now. All you have to do is run Anaconda.</p> <h2 id="the-challenge">the challenge</h2> <p>I first tried PlayOnLinux. That failed quickly. Then I tried to use wine by itself. That failed a bit later.</p> <p>Afterwards I used Crossover and that handed it straight to me: the graphics card was too old to run anything. And it actually worked‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ up to this, anyway.</p> <p><a href="/reviews/assets/img/new/Fedora.png"><picture><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Fedora-400-db59b9adb.webp 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Fedora-600-db59b9adb.webp 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Fedora-800-db59b9adb.webp 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Fedora-1000-db59b9adb.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Fedora-400-316873cdc.png 400w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Fedora-600-316873cdc.png 600w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Fedora-800-316873cdc.png 800w, /reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Fedora-1000-316873cdc.png 1000w" type="image/png"><img src="/reviews/generated/assets/img/new/Fedora-800-316873cdc.png" alt="Fedora desktop showing error 'Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is not responding.

It‚Äôs my distro of choice, that‚Äôs all.</p> <p>If you want a good, up to date and safe desktop experience with Linux, I think Fedora is probably the best call. Built on good stuff by good people, giving a vanilla edition of your favorite DE to improve upon by yourself is something that I think a lot of intermediate/advanced/fed-up users of Linux will enjoy, I know I do.</p> <p>If Linux had to be my main, I‚Äôd definitely choose Fedora now. But thankfully, it‚Äôs not.</p> <div class="flex flex-row gap-x-3"> <a href="/reviews/new/OpenBSD.html" class="generic-button" style="text-decoration: none !important" aria-label="Navigate to the previous review"> <div class="flex flex-column gap-x-3 items-center" aria-hidden="true"> <div> <svg class="w-6 h-6" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M12.707 5.293a1 1 0 010 1.414L9.414 10l3.293 3.293a1 1 0 01-1.414 1.414l-4-4a1 1 0 010-1.414l4-4a1 1 0 011.414 0z" clip-rule="evenodd"></path> </svg> </div> <div class="hidden md:inline">Previous</div> </div> </a> <a href="/reviews/old/fedora.html" class="generic-button" style="text-decoration: none !important" aria-label="Read the old review"> <span aria-hidden="true">üìñ Old</span> </a> <a href="/reviews/new/Zorin_OS.html" class="generic-button" style="text-decoration: none !important" aria-label="Navigate to the next review"> <div class="flex flex-column gap-x-3 items-center" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="hidden md:inline">Next</div> <div> <svg class="w-6 h-6" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="transform: scaleX(-1)"> <path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M12.707 5.293a1 1 0 010 1.414L9.414 10l3.293 3.293a1 1 0 01-1.414 1.414l-4-4a1 1 0 010-1.414l4-4a1 1 0 011.414 0z" clip-rule="evenodd"></path> </svg> </div> </div> </a> </div> </article> </body> </html>

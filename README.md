# x-t.github.io

monorepo for my personal site. it's cool. trust me.

designed with [Claris Home Page 2.0](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/932-claris-home-page-2-0), but built on modern technologies, like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), and [Go](https://go.dev/).

all parts of the site are preferred to be in-house.

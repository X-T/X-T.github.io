# x-t.github.io

my personal site. it's cool. trust me.

designed with [Claris Home Page 2.0](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/932-claris-home-page-2-0), uses [htmx](https://htmx.org/).

all parts of the site are preferred to be in-house. functionality of the site should be contained inside, without linking back to another domain/host.

## projects that live here

- [x-t.github.io](apps/web) - the frontend. it also lives on [cmp.neocities.org](https://cmp.neocities.org/).
- [guestbook3](apps/guestbook3) - the site's backend. includes more than the guestbook (lol)
